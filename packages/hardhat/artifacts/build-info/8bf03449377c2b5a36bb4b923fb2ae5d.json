@dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and\n total supply at the time are recorded for later access.\n This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.\n In naive implementations it's possible to perform a \"double spend\" attack by reusing the same balance from different\n accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be\n used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.\n Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a\n snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot\n id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id\n and the account address.\n NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it\n return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this\n function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.\n Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient\n alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.\n ==== Gas Costs\n Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log\n n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much\n smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.\n There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is\n only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent\n transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so

To change this, you should override this function so it returns a different value. We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit these events, as it isn't required by the specification.

TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How to implement supply mechanisms]. The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override this function so it returns a different value. We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit these events, as it isn't required by the specification. Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance} functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting allowances.

When a snapshot is created, the balances and total supply at the time are recorded for later access. This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting. In naive implementations it's possible to perform a \"double spend\" attack by reusing the same balance from different accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism. Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id and the account address. NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract. Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient alternative consider {ERC20Votes}. ==== Gas Costs Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry. There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.","events":{"Snapshot(uint256)":{"details":"Emitted by {_snapshot} when a snapshot identified by `id` is created."}},"kind":"dev","methods":{"allowance(address,address)":{"details":"See {IERC20-allowance}."},"approve(address,uint256)":{"details":"See {IERC20-approve}.

contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and total supply at the time are recorded for later access. This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting. In naive implementations it's possible to perform a \\\"double spend\\\" attack by reusing the same balance from different accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism. Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id and the account address. NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract. Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient alternative consider {ERC20Votes}. ==== Gas Costs Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry. There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.\",\"events\":{\"Snapshot(uint256)\":{\"details\":\"Emitted by {_snapshot} when a snapshot identified by `id` is created.\"}},\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{\"allowance(address,address)\":{\"details\":\"See {IERC20-allowance}.\"},\"approve(address,uint256)\":{\"details\":\"See {IERC20-approve}.

By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply.
